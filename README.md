# Demenstration of the code for the paper: *'Digital adiabatic evolution is universally accurate'*

This repository contains the Python source code for the numerical simulations presented in our paper: *'Digital adiabatic evolution is universally accurate'* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13966), including the Trotterized and GQSP-based Adiabatic State Preparation (ASP) for molecular systems, as well as the adiabatic algorithm for the Quantum Linear System Problem (QLSP).

## üìú File Descriptions

The repository is organized as follows:

* `Trotter_mole.py`: Main script to generate data for the Trotterized Adiabatic State Preparation (ASP) for molecules. This corresponds to **Fig 2(a)** and **Fig 3(a-c)** in our paper.
* `GQSP_mole.py`: Main script to generate data for the Generalized Quantum Signal Processing (GQSP)-based ASP for molecules. This corresponds to **Fig 3(d)** in our paper.
* `QLSP.py`: Main script to generate data for the adiabatic algorithm for the Quantum Linear System Problem (QLSP). This corresponds to **Fig 3(e-f)** in our paper.
* `utils.py`: A utility module containing helper functions used by the main scripts.
* `Func_for_QLSP.py`: A module containing specific functions required for the QLSP simulations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites & Installation

## 1. Before running the scripts, ensure you have Python 3 installed. You will also need to install the following required packages.

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip3 install numpy scipy pyscf openfermion cirq
```

## 2. Create Data Directory:
You are advised to create a folder named `Data` in the root directory of this project. The simulation results will be automatically saved there.

```bash
mkdir Data
```

## 3. Run the Scripts:
Execute the Python scripts from your terminal. Each script corresponds to different figures in the paper as described below.

* To reproduce Fig 2(a) and Fig 3(a-c):
```bash
python3 Trotter_mole.py
```

* To reproduce Fig 3(d):
```bash
python3 GQSP_mole.py
```

* To reproduce Fig 3(e-f):
```bash
python3 QLSP.py
```

## üìä Output
The scripts will run the simulations and save the output data files into the `Data/` directory. You can then use this data for analysis and plotting.
